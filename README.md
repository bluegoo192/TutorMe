# TutorMe

<i>Hackathon project for HackingEDU, Fall 2015</i>

TutorMe is a web application for connecting students to tutors.  Students enter the subjects they need help on(and other info like location and price range), and TutorMe contacts 
available tutors.  Once a match has been found, TutorMe uses Twilio to arrange an appointment over text.

This project isn't finished and is not being developed right now.  Uploaded for archival.
